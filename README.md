# NITCBASE
A layered, modular RDBMS implementation project developed in C++ as part of NIT Calicut's undergraduate curriculum. NITCbase simulates core database functionalities—DDL, DML, and indexing—through a custom disk format and SQL-like command-line interface. Ideal for learning how relational databases work under the hood.
